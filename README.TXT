PROJECT TITLE:Book Club Management

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The Book Club was set up during Covid. At present it allows only 5 members but that may change.
It needs to keep track of members so their information must be persisted/saved in memory. When a member joins,
they also add a book to the book list. The club will go read each book in order and that book is removed from the list.
However, they would like to keep track of all the books they have read and all present and past members
all information must be saved. Each month each member will contribute €5 to a kitty for food etc.
This will be used for organizing their annual dinner once as well.
They can pay in full if they require - €60 but if they leave will get a refund
of what is owning. Note the maximum number of payments is 12, that is one per month.
